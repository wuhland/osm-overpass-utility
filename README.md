osm-overpass-utility
====================

Easy way to scrape stuff from OSM based on its bounding-box, feature and optionally, feature value.
The idea is this will step users through a series of questions to determine what bounding box and features the user is interested in and then make a call to the overpass api for them. Why not just interact with the api directly? Good question. Go do that. 

If you want to continue using this script be aware that at this point it does not do anything fancy like autocorrect mispelled feature names so be sure you have reviewed the osm wiki and know that what you are typing is the correct.
